# Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate - TIKTOK Project

## About the project


At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.


In order to compelte this project we will use the PACE FRAMEWORK.

## PACE FRAMEWORK 

- **Plan**  The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide us through the process of completing the project.

- **Analyze**  The analyzing stage is where you will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.

- **Construct**  In the construction stage you will build models that will allow you access to hidden relationships locked within data.

- **Execute**  In the execution stage you will present the finding of your analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

# **Plan Stage**

## Project Overview
The goal of this TikTok project is to leverage machine learning to identify and classify claims and opinions within TikTok videos and comments. This classification will support the TikTok data team in content analysis and improve user experience by differentiating factual claims from personal opinions.

## Detailed Explanations for Each Task and Stage Selection

1. **Evaluating the model (Execute)**:  
   This stage involves testing the model’s performance to verify if it meets project expectations. It occurs post-construction when all elements are ready for evaluation.

2. **Conduct hypothesis testing (Analyze and Construct)**:  
   During analysis, statistical testing requirements are identified; in the construct phase, the actual testing is performed based on the chosen methodology.

3. **Begin exploring the data (Analyze)**:  
   Initial data exploration, conducted in the analysis phase, involves understanding the data’s scope, patterns, and any irregularities that could impact the project.

4. **Data exploration and cleaning (Plan and Analyze)**:  
   Planning outlines the cleaning strategy, and analysis executes the cleaning steps, preparing data for subsequent stages.

5. **Establish structure for project workflow (Plan)**:  
   This planning task defines the workflow (using PACE) to ensure a logical sequence and efficient management throughout the project.

6. **Communicate final insights (Execute)**:  
   During execution, insights, findings, and recommendations are shared with stakeholders, providing a basis for informed decision-making.

7. **Compute descriptive statistics (Analyze)**:  
   Descriptive statistics provide a foundational analysis, summarizing key data metrics to guide deeper investigative steps.

8. **Build visualizations (Analyze and Construct)**:  
   Visualization starts with analyzing data trends and relationships, followed by constructing charts, dashboards, or other visual tools.
